This app has functionalities that are similar to Facebook. It is implemented with Ruby on Rails. Users must sign in to see anything except the sign-in page. For authentication the gem Devise is used. Login with real Facebook accounts is possible due to the gem Omniauth. Users can write posts and comments, like other posts and send out and accept friendship requests. Images can be uploaded for user profiles as well as added to posts. The timeline shows all posts of the current user and his/her friends. The app is styled with the help of Bootstrap and fully responsive so that it can be viewed on screens of all sizes. To log in you can create a personal account, use your Facebook account or use these data: username: user1@test.org, password: foobar.

A live version of this app can be found at https://contactbook22.herokuapp.com

Requirements
Ruby on Rails to run the app locally.
